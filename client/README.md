# Ordersystem - UI

## Create Database

To make Ordersystem work properly, you need to create your own [database](https://console.firebase.google.com/). After creating an application for your db, just paste your config into both environment files (``client/src/environments/``)

## Start the application

### Development mode

#### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

#### Start in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

### Build Project

#### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

#### Build

```
npm run build
```

> **Important:** If you're planning to host this app, make sure to change the ``base-url`` param's value in the [package.json](https://github.com/dorfingerjonas/ordersystem/blob/master/client/package.json#L7).

### Lint

```
npm run lint
```
